add these to goal model via a migration:
team_summary_send_hour
team_summary_last_sent_date

set a default "team_summary_send_hour" of "noon" for everyone

on second thought, only do this for habitforge... forget the others
create notifier emails for forittobe, mylearninghabit and habitforge

in the email, cull from the "team" section on the site

modify the notifier
