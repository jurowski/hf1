Guys,

I like the Lunch Break feature.  Nice to have an extra reminder and team boost.

However, it would be good to have more people on my team(s).  I am working on two habits currently, and only have one other member on each team.

Hmm... thanks Mark. I see what you mean... as people leave teams due to inactivity, there's no merging of those on smaller teams, and new people are randomly added to those w/ openings.

I'll write a script to deal w/ this. Will try to have it working in a week or less.

Thanks for bringing this to my attention.
