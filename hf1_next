I am part of a team.
Around noon each day I want to see how my team is doing.
I want links in an email to send a message to those team mates.


add these to goal model via a migration:
team_summary_send_hour
team_summary_last_sent_date

set a default "team_summary_send_hour" of "noon" for everyone
(allow for nil values as well and default the equation to 12)

(only do this for habitforge, not for the other sites)

in the email, cull from the "team" section on the site

modify the notifier


------

I want to invite people to my team
send an invitation that they can "accept" if they want to be on my team

Under "friends", display anyone I've ever communicated with
...allow me to invite one of those "friends" to a team
