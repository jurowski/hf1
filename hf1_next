        ### hey, umm... relative success rate is not as simple as the below
        ### reason being is it has to be relative not only to the desired success rate
	### but you also need to take into consideration how many checked days per week there are
        ### meaning, if weekends are de-selected AND goal is 5 days per week, then relative and actual
        ### success rates are exactly the same, and modifying to relative would make it look too high
        relative_success_rate = (((yes_percent + 0.0) / self.desired_success_rate)*100).floor
        if relative_success_rate > 100
          relative_success_rate = 100
        end

I think it's time to work on SUCCESS PROGRAMS / TEMPLATES ... we can work on the rest of the tweaks after that

--------------------
now that you've done relative success rates for "overall",
see if you can do it for the lagging stats as well w/out breaking "bets" 
--------------------

-------------------------------
add achievemint to the template plan
------------------------------
add in flylady habit of the month as a "suggestion" or "template"
--------------------------
teamlunchemail: cull from autoupdate cinditional
----------------------------
Team success rate needs to be for one week and a three weeks
--------------------------------
Team show ranked table with grades for three days seven-day 21 day 30 day average
-----------------------------------
team add partic. pts to chart
------------------------------------


---------------------
FUTURE
---------------------
say: we'll let your team know you've checked in
and print last checkin
-------------------------------------
tokens/artwork is uploadable/competable by program for teams
---------------------
do weelky reports for followers
----------------------
make follower reports optional
------------------------
Teams compete for carousel artwork in templated habits
--------------------------------
if someone checks in with a "no", occasionally suggest that they join a team to help
------
I want to invite people to my team
send an invitation that they can "accept" if they want to be on my team
-------
Under "friends", display anyone I've ever communicated with
...allow me to invite one of those "friends" to a team
