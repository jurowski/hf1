:::CURRENT:::

--Stats a little off for kaybing (100% during last 30 days (wrong) but 27 days in a row (right)) for prod http://habitforge.com/goals/single/40822

--Display badges for those with 100+ 200+ ... etc. impact points

--Telling a long-standing goal to display all checkpoints takes forever... do some paging for this (ex: prod kaybing http://habitforge.com/goals/single/40822)




Custom Teams Overview
----------------------
i want to build my own custom team related to a goal
Allow for someone to Build a Custom Team in which there are openings ... so that people can seek out open teams and choose rather than having to be randomly assigned

Custom Teams ToDo
--------------------


[ ]  let me choose whether the team should restrict access for that goal itself (team-goal) or for the goal's general category (team-category)

[ ]  if team-goal, make each team goal the child of a template (if my goal is not yet a child, copy it to a parent template)

[ ]  suggest a team name, and let me edit it

[ ]  do not allow random assignments to my custom team

[ ]  let me be the owner of my team

[ ]  let me choose how many people are on my custom team

[ ]  let me craft an invite that has a link to start my goal (and if I have chosen category-level vs. goal-level, a link to start a custom or click from an array of templated goals in the same category)

[ ]  let me send invites to team members

[ ]  let my invite go to multiple email addresses separated by commas

[ ]  (teamgoals) do not kick people off of my custom team for not checking in

[ ]  do not let me quit a team that I am the leader of if there are other members
[ ]  allow me to transfer ownership to another member of the team
[ ]  notify every team member when a new member arrives
[ ]  notify every team member when a member leaves
[ ]  let me email the whole team
[ ]  when emailing one team member ask me to consider including each of the others

[ ]  when an invitee logs in, have an "invites" link at the top showing a red number and a listing of invites to review
[ ]  when an invitee accepts, take them to goal creation
[ ]  allow an invitee to silently ignore an invite (do not email me)
[ ]  allow an invitee to decline an invite (email me)
[ ]  keep reminding an invitee for a while until they take action

[ ]  later: team chat board
[ ]  later: weekly meeting for those who cited weekly meeting availability windows that match (you must attend 2/3 of the meetings over a 3 month period) ... meetings can be in a google hangout URL or in the built-in chat board
[ ]  later: nightly report option of "what went well today" and "what can i improve upon for tomorrow"

[ ]  later: add an icon/mascot/avatar for our team)
[ ]  later: add a "fade or not" photo mosaic linked to each team member's last 7 days ... one row per person)

-------------------- :::FUTURE::: -------------------------------

problem: if a cron job dies i am not aware
solution: look @ the latest cron job ... implement the same (it has a notify gmail that a script died)


future: put a silver or gold badge next to names on dynamic (and in their account) for impact point levels

future: make an option for showing in dynamic only those goals in your categories
future: make an option for showing in dynamic all except porn/masterbate

future: program creation like the UWHealth "holiday don't gain"


-------------------- :::DONE::: -------------------------------

problem: people are starting to ask to cash in support points more than once
solution: 
add a new user field that indicates that they've cashed one in already
modify the admin interface to indicate this and to not allow the single-press button
