:::CURRENT::: 

Goal creation form:

Does succeeding depend on some number you'd like us to ask you about? (ex: hours of sleep, weight in pounds, # of glasses of water, an overall mood rating, number of sales calls, etc.)

We'll test out two cases at first, both of which would have a max :
--one that occasionally measures something that "is" (weight)
--one that daily measures something that you achieve daily (sleep)



NEXT/NOW/CURRENT: 


!!! for templated weight loss, as their current weight to auto-fill in the ranges


-- WEDNESDAYS ONLY: not sure if weekly_report_of_goals_i_follow is working w/out fail




-------------------- :::FUTURE::: -------------------------------

--fitbit integration for a step tracker and sleep tracker


--when someone accepts a team invitation and joins that team, a message needs to go out to every member of the team, and it should prompt each member to send a welcome message to that new team member

--email team members when someone leaves the team

--someone who already has a goal needs to be able to join it to a team if a matching invitation exists



(for admin user only for now... eventually enable for everyone but only once we have a searchable library that would make it relevant for others to find)
1. make a button in the normal "goals" view that checks if the goal is already part of a template... and if it's not, enable a button that would kick off copy_goal_to_template_and_make_template_parent



-- email the team when someone is slacking a lot and might be removed because of it

modify team:new and team:edit forms so that only relevant fields are shown to owners
change rights on team controller methods so that no one but admin and team owner can edit or delete a team
do not let owner change a team "type" from category to goal-specific once it is created (force delete instead)



[ ]  let me craft an invite that has a link to start my goal (and if I have chosen category-level vs. goal-level, a link to start a custom or click from an array of templated goals in the same category)

[ ]  let my invite go to multiple email addresses separated by commas

[ ]  (teamgoals) do not kick people off of my custom team for not checking in

[ ]  allow me to transfer ownership to another member of the team
[ ]  notify every team member when a new member arrives
[ ]  notify every team member when a member leaves
[ ]  let me email the whole team
[ ]  when emailing one team member ask me to consider including each of the others

[ ]  when an invitee logs in, have an "invites" link at the top showing a red number and a listing of invites to review

[ ]  allow an invitee to silently ignore an invite (do not email me)
[ ]  allow an invitee to decline an invite (email me)
[ ]  keep reminding an invitee for a while until they take action

[ ]  later: team chat board
[ ]  later: weekly meeting for those who cited weekly meeting availability windows that match (you must attend 2/3 of the meetings over a 3 month period) ... meetings can be in a google hangout URL or in the built-in chat board
[ ]  later: nightly report option of "what went well today" and "what can i improve upon for tomorrow"

[ ]  later: add an icon/mascot/avatar for our team)
[ ]  later: add a "fade or not" photo mosaic linked to each team member's last 7 days ... one row per person)






--Display badges for those with 100+ 200+ ... etc. impact points

--Telling a long-standing goal to display all checkpoints takes forever... do some paging for this (ex: prod kaybing http://habitforge.com/goals/single/40822)



problem: if a cron job dies i am not aware
solution: look @ the latest cron job ... implement the same (it has a notify gmail that a script died)


future: put a silver or gold badge next to names on dynamic (and in their account) for impact point levels

future: make an option for showing in dynamic only those goals in your categories

future: program creation like the UWHealth "holiday don't gain"


-------------------- :::DONE::: -------------------------------

problem: people are starting to ask to cash in support points more than once
solution: 
add a new user field that indicates that they've cashed one in already
modify the admin interface to indicate this and to not allow the single-press button
