I am part of a team.
Around noon each day I want to see how my team is doing.
I want links in an email to send a message to those team mates.


add these to goal model via a migration:
team_summary_send_hour
team_summary_last_sent_date

set a default "team_summary_send_hour" of "noon" for everyone
(allow for nil values as well and default the equation to 12)

(only do this for habitforge, not for the other sites)

in the email, cull from the "team" section on the site

modify the notifier
