Custom Teams
-----------------
i want to build my own custom team related to a goal
let me choose whether the team is for the goal itself (team-goal) or for the goal's general category (team-category)
if team-goal, make each team goal the child of a template (if my goal is not yet a child, copy it to a parent template)
suggest a team name, and let me edit it
do not allow random assignments to my custom team
let me be the owner of my team
let me choose how many people are on my custom team
let me craft an invite that has a link to start my goal (and if I have chosen category-level vs. goal-level, a link to start a custom or click from an array of templated goals in the same category)
let me send invites to team members
let my invite go to multiple email addresses separated by commas
(teamgoals) do not kick people off of my custom team for not checking in
do not let me quit a team that I am the leader of if there are other members
allow me to transfer ownership to another member of the team
notify every team member when a new member arrives
notify every team member when a member leaves
let me email the whole team
when emailing one team member ask me to consider including each of the others

when an invitee logs in, have an "invites" link at the top showing a red number and a listing of invites to review
when an invitee accepts, take them to goal creation
allow an invitee to silently ignore an invite (do not email me)
allow an invitee to decline an invite (email me)
keep reminding an invitee for a while until they take action

(later: add an icon/mascot/avatar for our team)
(later: add a "fade or not" photo mosaic linked to each team member's last 7 days ... one row per person)

----------------------
mod table "teams"
----------------------
goal_template_parent_id (nil if category only)
custom # boolean, nil or false if randomized team)
