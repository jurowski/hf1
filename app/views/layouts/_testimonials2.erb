            "<span>I've had a very hard time with eating fast food over the course of 20 years.</span>  I just love the taste and no matter what I've tried to do I couldn't stop.  Then one day I ran across this website and it made a tremendous difference in fighting my fast food eating behavior.  The website helped reinforce what I needed to do over and over again on a daily basis and with the proper motivational quotes I was able to build momentum each and every day to be successful.  I haven't looked back since.  <span>I went from 10% bodyfat to 4% bodyfat.  My physique transformation is truly amazing.  If I can do it so can anyone else.</span>

            "<span>Habitforge is a phenomenal change tool.</span> As a public health professional and trained social worker, I find their service perfect for scheduling the right time to plant an email trigger and and their "extra accountability" program is exceptional. I would recommend this to anyone, especially busy professionals, who check their email frequently and want a friendly automated reminder. Habitforge has literally helped me implement a core habit, Meditation, after years of failing and I'm more mindful and relaxed due to this great service.

With that 'silly' little HabitForge reminder, I got the prod I needed to just do it. Stubborn pride, I guess, but I was determined not to break the perfect string of daily practice.

One of the reasons I kept failing before was that you hang in there for a couple of days then you let it slip once, then twice to the point where you no longer can feel the initial desire to accomplish the task. Thanks to habitforge there was no running from it! Even your best mates cant be bothered to keep reminding you how important it is for you to achieve a certain thing. Grows sour after a bit. Habitforge doesn't mind. Pops up inbetween your mails and knocks it to your head without feeling awkward :)"
