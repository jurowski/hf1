I'd also like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank those who make HabitForge possible. Using your site, I have been able to quit smoking for good, finally. The work you guys do has literally changed my life, and I think you need to know that. So simply, Thank you!

Habitforge is really helpful for building new empowering habits or breaking old negative ones. I stopped watching TV and feel a lot more mindful now on a daily basis. I feel positive and working on my goals every day.

"Thanks to this little bit of accountability each day I'm able to say I can break a life long habit. It's funny how one simple e-mail each day can give me the motivation to not eat anything after supper and I've never felt more healthier.
This website is a great idea and together we've made a difference in my daily habits. I often recommend this to my friends who are seeking their own self improvement goals. Thanks!"

"I have been writing screenplays for almost ten years now, and although I've had some minor successes, for the most part my career has been a litany of near misses and soul destroying rejection. It used to get me down, but none of that touches me anymore. For 387 days (so far) I have met my writing goal, and I plan to meet it every day for the rest of my life. In a business that breeds failure, Habitforge has helped me to find a way to achieve daily success, thank-you."

"HabitForge is an amazing tool!  It overcomes the main obstacle of creating a habit -- remembering to do it!  I've used it for several habits and, though I sometimes have to re-form old habits if I get lazy about them later on, HabitForge always sets me back on track.  Sometimes I'll do another 21-day term to help ingrain the habit deeper, but even just one term has fixed all kinds of unproductive and unhealthy habits of mine in the past.  Thanks for getting me together, HabitForge!"

"Habitforge has been instrumental in my everyday success. I get a reminder to write every day and also an e-mail to check in about my progress. I think about the morning when I have to check in with a Yes or No, and I'd much rather click on Yes. So, I get moving and accomplish today's goals. Habitforge is a gentle yet profound way to keep on track and be successful."

"Habitforge has helped me to make a habit of going through life more consciously by taking a moment every day to reflect on whether I approached the day before in the way I wanted. It has helped me not only to be more in control of the way I organise my day, but also to have a more accurate picture of my own acheivements and where and how I go wrong. This highly visible feedback mechanism has helped me to take baby steps towards the goals I have set  myself, and to acheive long-lasting change.
Motivation must always come from within, but Habitforge is an excellent tool to help you along the way.
Thank you!"

"Hi Habitforge,
I discovered your website 2 years ago when I was stumbling upon the Internet and thought it could be a useful tool to help get back into the sports mood. I tried a "do pushups" habit everyday but sadly it didn't work out so much. I put the habit on hold after 10 days and didn't go back to the website since. Now I am a little older and a little more mature and I realize the important potential that Habitforge has in improving one's life. I decided to get back to the website and try a "Write 500 words a day" habit and I am proud to announce that I have just finished my 21 days straight! It was quite hard more than a couple of times, I would often have a very hectic day and come back home tired and ready to sleep and then I would remember that I still did not write my required words for the day and I would muster the courage to get up to the laptop and do the deed; the dread of clicking "No" on the next morning email and having to face another failure in this program gave me the courage and energy to keep going every day. Habitforge was good for me and I plan on using it more in the future.Sadly, I only racked up 30 support points in the process so not enough to earn the full membership. Being Moroccan and living in Morocco, I do not own a credit card valid enough to pay for services through the Internet, so I will have to wait until I have an occasion in the future to meet someone who can pay for this service for me in exchange for the currency I will give them. Until then, I will have to do with one habit at a time and that is fine with me. It is with little steps like these, every single day, that we can build the life that we want for ourselves. Habitforge greatly helped in reminding to take these little steps and I thank you for that."

"I find Habitforge a great reminder for taking my water and vitamins, i get too busy and time passes by, before i know it, the day is gone and i have not done this.  I work at my desk all day and having the email reminders makes a big difference, i get the email, i get up and get my water and vitamins, it's that simple.  It's GREAT !! Plus, there are no excuses, it holds me accountable."

"Everyone always says that if you want to stick to a goal, tell all your friends about it. Well, habit forge works in the same way for me. I always feel like someone's watching. Seeing the little circles fill up each day towards the sacred number 21 gives me a thrill. I especially like the fact that if you fail, you have to start all over. That way, I never land up telling myself "ah! I'll cut myself some slack today" or, "I worked out, I deserve one piece of chocolate...just one." The thing is, it's never just one. And with habitforge, its none. And it works. That's why I love it.  Forming teams is great too. In some weird way, I feel more motivated towards my goals when I motivate others towards theirs. It's almost like I have no right to preach if I don't follow my advice. It's my birthday weekend now and I've ALLOWED myself to take a break from my goal of no sweets. But I still find myself avoiding them if I can. I guess it's a habit now =) Thanks habitforge!!!"

"I have been remembering to attain my goal because HabitForge sends me an email every day.  Before I joined HabitForge I used to put off doing my goal and Habitforge keeps me on my toes!
If I do forget, then the email sent to check that I attained my goal for the day before, nudges me to do it today."

"Habitforge was really helpful for helping me get out of the habit of late night snacking.  I was really ready for a change, and had clear benefits & detriments all thought out.  It's funny how just the thought: "I'd love to eat now, but I'd have to restart all over again," was enough to stop me on the most challenging nights.  I'm sticking with this habit for another three weeks--I really want it firmly engrained!"

"Dear Habbitforge friends:
I am glad I found you guys. I have been struggling to achieve many types of different goals and fortunately your website is just what I was looking foor.
I started with one habbit that I want to incorporate fully in my life: praying.
As silly as it sounds (for me at least), I have not been able to talk to God propperly every day of my life.
It is an important part of my life but there are somedays where I just did not remember who created me and who I owe everything. . . .
Thanks to your constant reminders. I have been able to reach up to 17 days straight of connecting to my higher self. Thanks a lot.
I would like to start sowing more seeds with your help but for the time being I will continue to pursue my first 21days in a row praying practice.
God bless you for this amazing website."

"Thanks for the opportunity to give feedback.  Since Habitforge has been sending me reminders daily about my goal which is to walk for 30 minutes a day, briskly, I have found it to be so helpful in that I know that I have to be accountable each day and because I am being honest, I try not to set myself up to feel guilty.  I have lost 3.6kg and am now walking up steep hills quite easily.  At the age of 60 years exercise is important and having the support of someone else keeps me motivated and determined to keep my healthy focus.   I have sent the Habitforge website to many people who have also reported they love the daily reminders and "attaboys".  I also feel I have achieved my goal of looking better in my trendy clothes and my husband definitely likes my leaner self and is impressed with my commitment to exercise.  Thanks Habitforge for your help."
<span style="font-weight:bold;">--Kind regards, Chris</span>
