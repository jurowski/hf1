</p></li>


<li><p style="color:#000000;text-shadow:none;font-family:arial;width:290px;">

<li><p style="color:#000000;text-shadow:none;font-family:arial;width:290px;">
<br><br>I'd also like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank those who make HabitForge possible. Using your site, I have been able to quit smoking for good, finally. The work you guys do has literally changed my life, and I think you need to know that. So simply, Thank you!

<br><br>Habitforge is really helpful for building new empowering habits or breaking old negative ones. I stopped watching TV and feel a lot more mindful now on a daily basis. I feel positive and working on my goals every day.
<span style="font-weight:bold;">--Dimitar Petrov</span>
</p></li>

<li><p style="color:#000000;text-shadow:none;font-family:arial;width:290px;">
<br><br>"Thanks to this little bit of accountability each day I'm able to say I can break a life long habit. It's funny how one simple e-mail each day can give me the motivation to not eat anything after supper and I've never felt more healthier. I often recommend this to my friends who are seeking their own self improvement goals. Thanks!"

<li><p style="color:#000000;text-shadow:none;font-family:arial;width:290px;">

<li><p style="color:#000000;text-shadow:none;font-family:arial;width:290px;">
<br>"I have been writing screenplays for almost ten years now, and although I've had some minor successes, for the most part my career has been a litany of near misses and soul destroying rejection...but none of that touches me anymore. For 387 days (so far) I have met my writing goal, and I plan to meet it every day for the rest of my life. In a business that breeds failure, Habitforge has helped me to find a way to achieve daily success, thank-you."
<span style="font-weight:bold;">--David from Toronto</span>
</p></li>

<li><p style="color:#000000;text-shadow:none;font-family:arial;width:290px;">
<br>"HabitForge is an amazing tool!  It overcomes the main obstacle of creating a habit -- remembering to do it!  I've used it for several habits...  Sometimes I'll do another 21-day term to help ingrain the habit deeper, but even just one term has fixed all kinds of unproductive and unhealthy habits of mine in the past.  Thanks for getting me together, HabitForge!"
<span style="font-weight:bold;">-- Greg, St. Louis, MO</span>
</p></li>

<li><p style="color:#000000;text-shadow:none;font-family:arial;width:290px;">
<br>"Habitforge has been instrumental in my everyday success. I get a reminder to write every day and also an e-mail to check in about my progress. I think about the morning when I have to check in with a Yes or No, and I'd much rather click on Yes. So, I get moving and accomplish today's goals. Habitforge is a gentle yet profound way to keep on track and be successful."
<span style="font-weight:bold;">--Barb, Minneapolis</span>
</p></li>

<li><p style="color:#000000;text-shadow:none;font-family:arial;width:290px;">
<br><br>"HF is a gentle electronic 'nudge' every morning! We have so many things 'on our plate' that forming good habits can easily get lost in the day's busi-ness...but HF at least gives forming a new habit traction:*D "

<li><p style="color:#000000;text-shadow:none;font-family:arial;width:290px;">
<br><br>"A great tool for building a better you. Cheesy, I know, but nonetheless true. I'm going on day 67 of following my simple, but effective exercise plan."
<span style="font-weight:bold;">--Lauge, Denmark</span>
</p></li>




<li><p style="color:#000000;text-shadow:none;font-family:arial;width:290px;">
<br>"I find Habitforge a great reminder for taking my water and vitamins, i get too busy and time passes by, before i know it, the day is gone and i have not done this.  I work at my desk all day and having the email reminders makes a big difference, i get the email, i get up and get my water and vitamins, it's that simple.  It's GREAT !! Plus, there are no excuses, it holds me accountable."

<li><p style="color:#000000;text-shadow:none;font-family:arial;width:290px;">
<br>"I have been remembering to attain my goal because HabitForge sends me an email every day.  Before I joined HabitForge I used to put off doing my goal and Habitforge keeps me on my toes!
If I do forget, then the email sent to check that I attained my goal for the day before, nudges me to do it today."

<li><p style="color:#000000;text-shadow:none;font-family:arial;width:290px;">
<br>"Habitforge was really helpful for helping me get out of the habit of late night snacking.  I was really ready for a change, and had clear benefits & detriments all thought out.  It's funny how just the thought: "I'd love to eat now, but I'd have to restart all over again," was enough to stop me on the most challenging nights.  I'm sticking with this habit for another three weeks--I really want it firmly engrained!"

<li><p style="color:#000000;text-shadow:none;font-family:arial;width:290px;">
