Hello <%= @coachgoal.coach.user.first_name %>.

A "Weekly Check-in Email" is now due for <%= @coachgoal.user.first_name %>'s goal of "<%= @coachgoal.goal.title %>" in the category of "<%= @coachgoal.goal.category %>".

Within the next couple of days (or later if you've already agreed to that with the client) please check on his/her progress via the "Coaching" tab on HabitForge ( http://habitforge.com ), and through that tab, please send them an "Official Weekly Check-in Email" to help motivate them to sticking with their goal!

(Once you've sent the fourth weekly message to <%= @coachgoal.user.first_name %> (on or after <%= @coachgoal.week_4_email_due_date %>), the client will rate their experience, and I'll be sending you a payment for $<%= @coachgoal.amount_client_paid_split_to_coach %>).

If you have any questions, please let me know!

Thanks so much.
