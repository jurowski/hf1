                 You are receiving this message because <%= @from_user.first_name %> was asked to give you a "push" since you haven't checked in with a "yes" these past few days.

                 You won't get more than <%= @slacker_goal.pushes_allowed_per_day %> of these per day. To no longer allow HabitForge members to "push" you, or to manage other aspects of this goal or of your account, log into <a href="http://habitforge.com">http://habitforge.com</a>
