<%= @user.first_name %>, 

Thanks for Playing for a Cause!

Your <%= @bet.length_days %>-day challenge for $<%= @bet.wager %> runs from <%= @bet.start_date.strftime("%A, %b %d, %Y") %> through <%= @bet.end_date.strftime("%A, %b %d, %Y") %>.

You need to succeed at least <%= @bet.floor%>% out of the <%= @bet.length_days %>-day challenge period, or you'll owe <%= @bet.recipient_name %> $<%= @bet.wager %>!

We'll send another email at the end of the challenge period with the results.




Details: How "Playing for a Cause" Works

We'll send email notices to you and your chosen charity (<%= @bet.recipient_name %>) twice:
    • Immediately (Prior to the first day of the challenge)
    • Within Two Days After the challenge period ends to detail what you owe <%= @bet.recipient_name %>, if anything.

If you end up "owing" <%= @bet.recipient_name %>, paypal is quick and easy, but a mailed personal check could work as well. (We will provide you with their donation-related web address.)

How will we know you made the payment to them? It's on the honor system, so we will not collect money or broker the transaction, but since we are sending notices to the <%= @bet.recipient_name %> of what you'd owe, it should help you keep your word! 



Best of luck with your goal!
