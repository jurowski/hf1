<%= @user.first_name %>, 

Thanks for adding some Extra Accountability to your goal through our "Fire" feature!

You've chosen to make <%= @bet.recipient_name %> your potential recipient.

Your <%= @bet.length_days %>-day challenge for $<%= @bet.wager %> runs from <%= @bet.start_date.strftime("%A, %b %d, %Y") %> through <%= @bet.end_date.strftime("%A, %b %d, %Y") %>.

You need to succeed at least <%= @bet.floor%>% out of the <%= @bet.length_days %>-day challenge period, or you'll owe <%= @bet.recipient_name %> $<%= @bet.wager %>!

We'll send another email at the end of the challenge period with the results.

(<%= @bet.recipient_name %>, if you're not already signed up with HabitForge (http://habitforge.com), feel free to sign up under your <%= @bet.recipient_email %> address, and you'll be able to see <%= @user.first_name %>'s goal progress under the "Friends" tab.)


Details: How "Fire" or "Extra Accountability" Works

We'll send email notices to you and your friend twice:
    • Immediately (Prior to the first day of the challenge)
    • Within Two Days After the challenge period ends to detail what you owe them, if anything.

If you do end up "owing" <%= @bet.recipient_name %>, paypal is quick and easy, but a mailed personal check could work as well (we'll let the two of you work it out).

How will we know you made the payment to them? It's on the honor system, so we will not collect money or broker the transaction, but since we are sending notices to the recipient of what you'd owe, be a pal and keep your word! 



Best of luck with your goal!
