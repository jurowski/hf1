Congratulations <%= @user.first_name %>!

You have just become the newest Premium Member of HabitForge!


At HabitForge we are on a mission... to change the world one habit at a time. By 
helping you at first to consciously make a better choice each and every day until 
eventually the "better choice" is an automatic response. 

Our goal is simply to help you live more fully and enjoy a healthier, happier life.

As we continue to develop HabitForge, we will be digging further into the nuts and 
bolts and nuances behind habit formation... converting  the "what and how" that 
world-renowned scientists have revealed during their past 20 years of "positive 
psychology research" into simple, practical HabitForge features that will help you 
get there faster than ever.


Your subscription includes:

-- Unlimited Active Habits: 
Work on as many habits as you'd like. Put "on hold" those you want to tackle down the road.

-- Team Support: 
Join a team of 3 other HabitForge members who are working on forming a habit in the same 
category as you. Encourage one another to succeed as you work toward bringing your team's 
success rate closer to 100%.

-- "Customized Friendly Pushes" from HabitForge Members if you start to slack: 
You determine the phrases that would be the most helpful to hear to get you back on track 
if you did start to slack. If you don't succeed for a few days, we incentivize HabitForge 
members to choose one of those phrases to "push your buttons", so to speak. If you succeed 
shortly thereafter, they receive additional rewards.

-- Private Habit Option: 
Create habits that are never visible to the outside world or to other HabitForge members.

-- Frequent Daily Reminders Option: If you would like more than just one email reminder during 
the day to stay on track with the habit you are working on, you can enable "frequent reminders" 
to email you several times throughout the day.

-- Ad-Free usage of HabitForge: 
You'll no longer see ads when using HabitForge.

-- An Unconditional 30-day Money Back Guarantee: 
If for any reason you decide that HabitForge Premium isn't for you, simply request a refund 
within 30 days, no questions asked.

Get ready to start living a better life by making "better choices" automatic, and toss aside 
the thoughts and behaviors that until now have held you back.


Best of luck with your goals, and let us know if you have any questions!
