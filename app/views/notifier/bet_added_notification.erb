<%= @user.first_name %>, thanks so much for Playing for a Cause through HabitForge!

Remember, the more you succeed, the more your charity wins! 

Your Success Rate after 30 days controls the dollar amount that we donate in your name to your selected charity!

The success rate that you log through HabitForge during the next 30 days will determine the percentage that is donated in your name to the charity you've selected (up to 100% !).

After the 30 day period, we'll make a donation to your chosen charity in your name, and we'll send you an email receipt showing what you donated to them, which you can use for tax deduction purposes. 

Note: The remaining portion (100% minus your Success Rate), goes to support HabitForge development, and is not tax deductible. The donation process is manual, but you can expect the donation to occur within 3 business days after the 30-day period expires.

Thanks again, and let me know if you have any questions!
