<%= @user.first_name %>, 

Thanks for using the HabitForge "Fire" (Extra Accountability) Feature to your goal!

We've randomly chosen <%= @bet.recipient_name %> from our pool of HabitForge supporting members as your potential challenge recipient.

Your <%= @bet.length_days %>-day challenge for $<%= @bet.wager %> runs from <%= @bet.start_date.strftime("%A, %b %d, %Y") %> through <%= @bet.end_date.strftime("%A, %b %d, %Y") %>.

You need to succeed at least <%= @bet.floor%>% out of the <%= @bet.length_days %>-day challenge period, or you'll owe <%= @bet.recipient_name %> $<%= @bet.wager %>!

We'll send another email at the end of the challenge period with the results.




Details: How "Fire" or "Extra Accountability" Works

We'll send email notices to you and <%= @bet.recipient_name %> twice:
    • Immediately (Prior to the first day of the challenge)
    • Within Two Days After the challenge period ends to detail what you owe <%= @bet.recipient_name %>, if anything.

If you do end up "owing" <%= @bet.recipient_name %>, paypal is quick and easy, but a mailed personal check could work as well (we'll let the two of you work it out).

How will we know you made the payment to them? It's on the honor system, so we will not collect money or broker the transaction, but since we are sending notices to the recipient of what you'd owe, be a pal and keep your word! 



Best of luck with your goal!
