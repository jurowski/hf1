                            <h4>Details: How "Bet a Friend or Play for a Cause" Works</h4>
                            <p>If someone chooses to place a wager on their success rate with a goal over a period of time, they have the option of randomly selecting a Supporting Member to be the recipient of the cash they put on the line in the event that they don't meet their goal. By "opting in" you're acknowledging that you would like to be a part of this "random pool". In other words, you could get some cash without having to do anything. We'd send email notices to you and the HabitForge member placing the wager twice: 
                            <br> &nbsp &nbsp • Immediately (Prior to the first day of the challenge)
                            <br> &nbsp &nbsp • Within Two Days After the challenge period ends to detail what they owe you, if anything.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            If they end up "owing you", you can send a message to them through HabitForge to decide how they can pay you (paypal is quick and easy, but a mailed personal check could work as well). 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            How will we know they made the payment to you? It's on the honor system, so we will not collect money or broker the transaction, but since we are sending notices to both parties of what is owed, it should help them keep their word! </p>
                        </div>
